                    <p>On this website, I keep all the recipes I love. It's a personal collection built from memorable eating experiences, experiments in the kitchen, 
                        and moments when a dish truly hit the spot. Whenever I'm unsure about what to cook, I come here for inspiration. <br><br>
                        All of the meals you'll find here are vegetarian. I made the switch a few years ago after watching footage of the animal industry â€” 
                        it opened my eyes and made me truly reflect on what I was eating. Since then, I've chosen to avoid meat, 
                        not only out of compassion for animals but also because of the environmental impact of meat production. 
                        Cooking and eating this way feels more in line with my values, and it turns out, it can be incredibly delicious too. <br><br>
                        
                        I hope this collection inspires you as much as it inspires me.
